## Features

### 👾 **Bento Grid Layout**
The portfolio uses a **bento-style grid layout** to organize content into visually distinct sections. The grid is responsive and adjusts based on screen size, ensuring a seamless experience across devices

### 🖱️ **Interactive GIF**
The follower image changes from a static PNG to an animated GIF when hovered over, adding to the cutesy jiggly movement as seen in *Cult of the Lamb*

### ✒️ **Typography**
The portfolio uses two Google Fonts taken from visually similiar looking fonts:
- **Eczar**: Headings
- **Gowun Batang**: Body text

### 🔗 **Social Media Links**
Social media icons are included for GitHub, Discord and LinkedIn
